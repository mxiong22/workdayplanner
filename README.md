# Daily Scheduler Challenge #5

## Description
The motivation of this challege was to build off of starter code to creat a daily planner hourly during business hours and to be organized by color-coded time blocks. Once the user enters a description of their daily task and saves the note, it will be logged and saved into the local storage.
